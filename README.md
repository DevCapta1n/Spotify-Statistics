# Capstone-One-Spotify-Statistics
The API being used for this site is the Spotify api. I will only use three parts of the api: authorization, personalization, and user profile. 

The endpoint for the personalization part of the api is https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/{type} and the link to the docs is https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#endpoint-get-users-top-artists-and-tracks.

For the user profile the endpoint is https://api.spotify.com/v1/me and the link to the docs is https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#endpoint-get-current-users-profile. 

Finally the authorization section has documentation at this link https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/ and it covers all parts of authorizing a user. 

The overall api link is https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/ .

The favicon is original by Jack Winford but does include an edited copy of 
the Spotify icon.

This branch is designed to run locally as opposed to the 'display' branch which is designed to run on Heroku.
